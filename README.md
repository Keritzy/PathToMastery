  Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

#### Line Breaks(2 invisible spaces after each line)
We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
# Analysis of Algorithms

## Imp Points:
  
  For any two functions f(n) and g(n), we have f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)).
  
  Time complexity of all computer algorithms can be written as Ω(1)
