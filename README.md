This is the repostitory of all the algorithms problems that I will encounter during my journey to the mastery of algorithms.

# Analysis of Algorithms

## Imp Points:
  
  For any two functions f(n) and g(n), we have f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)).
  
  Time complexity of all computer algorithms can be written as Ω(1)
